# Concurrent Petri Net

Petri Net implementation based on golang concurrency patterns such as goroutines and channels

## Examples

Here're several example for Petri Net usage:
- [Simple Petri Net](./example/ptp/main.go) is an elementary network contains two places `in` and `out` and just one 
 transition
- [Echo server](./example/echo/README.md) is an implementation of HTTP echo server as a Petri Net 

## Benchmark

Solution overhead is about 3-5Î¼s per transition

```
$: make bench
