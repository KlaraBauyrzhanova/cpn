# Concurrent Petri Net

Petri Net implementation based on golang concurrency patterns such as goroutines and channels

## Examples

Here're several example for Petri Net usage:
- [{ pin -> {t1 t2} -> pout }](./example/ptp/main.go) is an elementary network contains two places `in` and `out` and 
 concurrent transitions
- [{req -> echo -> res}}](./example/echo/README.md) is an implementation of HTTP echo server as a Petri Net 

## Benchmark

Solution overhead is about 3-5Î¼s per transition
